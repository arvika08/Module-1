# Experiment No: 1c-Write a python program to read two integers and perform simple arithmetic calculation.(+,-,*,/,//,%,**)

## AIM
To write a Python program to read two integers and perform simple arithmetic calculation.(+,-,*,/,//,%,**)

## ALGORITHM
Start

Read an integer a from the user

Read an integer b from the user

Calculate add = a + b

Calculate sub = a - b

Calculate mul = a * b

Calculate div = a / b (normal division)

Calculate sla = a // b (floor division)

Calculate mod = a % b (modulus)

Calculate powe = a ** b (power)

Print the results of add, sub, mul, div, sla, mod, and powe each on a new line

End

## PROGRAM

a=int(input())

b=int(input())

add=a+b

sub=a-b

mul=a*b

div=a/b

sla=a//b

mod=a%b

powe=a**b

print(f"{add}\n{sub}\n{mul}\n{div}\n{sla}\n{mod}\n{powe}")

## RESULT
Thus, the python program to read two integers and perform simple arithmetic calculation.(+,-,*,/,//,%,**) was implemented successfully.
