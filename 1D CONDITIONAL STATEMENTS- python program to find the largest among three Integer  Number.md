## Experiment No: 1d – Conditional Statements- python program to find the largest among three Integer  Number.

## AIM  
To Write a Python program to find the largest among three integer number.
## ALGORITHM  
Start

Read integer a from the user

Read integer b from the user

Read integer c from the user

If a is greater than both b and c, then
→ Print that a is the largest

Else if b is greater than both a and c, then
→ Print that b is the largest

Else
→ Print that c is the largest

End
## PROGRAM
a=int(input())

b=int(input())

c=int(input())

if a>b and a>c:

    print("The largest of the three a=",a,"b= c=",c,"is",a)
    
elif b>a and b>c:

    print("The largest of the three a=",a,"b= c=",c,"is",b)
    
else:

    print("The largest of the three a=",a,"b= c=",c,"is",c)
