# Experiment No: 1B- Data Types â€“ Correct the python program to read and print the complex number

## AIM  
To write a Python program to print the complex number.

## ALGORITHM  
Start

Read an integer a from the user

Read an integer b from the user

Create a complex number c using a as the real part and b as the imaginary part

Print the complex number c

End

## PROGRAM
a=int(input())

b=int(input())

c=complex(a,b)

print(c)
