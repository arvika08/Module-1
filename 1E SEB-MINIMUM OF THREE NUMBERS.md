# Experiment No: 1e – SEB-write a python program to check whether the two float numbers are equal using conditional expression (Ternary)

## AIM  
To write a Python program to check whether the two float numbers are equal using conditional expression (Ternary).

## ALGORITHM  
Start

Read float number a

Read float number b

Use ternary operator to check:

  If a == b, then set result to "True"
  
  Else, set result to "False"

Print the result

End
## PROGRAM
a = float(input("Enter first float number: "))

b = float(input("Enter second float number: "))

result = "True" if a == b else "False"

print(result)

## RESULT
Thus, python program to check whether the two float numbers are equal using conditional expression (Ternary) was implemented successfully.
